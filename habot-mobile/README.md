# habot-mobile

Cross-platform mobile app for Habot, built with **Flutter** and maintained by the **UDF** team.

The Flutter project lives in [`udf_setup/`](udf_setup).

## Getting started

```bash
cd udf_setup
flutter pub get     # install dependencies
flutter run         # run on a connected device / emulator
```

`flutter run` opens a design-system probe screen that exercises every primitive built so far.
Tap the grid icon in the header to overlay the live column/gutter/rhythm wireframe.

## Verify before you commit

```bash
cd udf_setup
./tool/verify_aiss.sh          # format, analyze, poka-yoke guard, 72 AISS gates, evidence roll-up
./tool/verify_aiss.sh --check  # CI mode: fails on unformatted code instead of formatting it
```

Exits non-zero on the first failure and writes `build/aiss/evidence.json` plus
`build/aiss/contrast_audit.txt`. Deferred gates (recorded open decisions) are listed separately
and do **not** fail the run — only unexplained breakage does.

Full explanation of what each gate defends and why:
`../Others/Fredrick/AISS_Verification_Methodology.md`.

## Design system

Everything visual comes from `udf_setup/lib/design_system`. Four rules, all machine-enforced:

1. **No raw values in `lib/`.** No hex colours, no bare numbers inside `EdgeInsets`,
   `BorderRadius` or `SizedBox`. Import a token instead.
2. **`tokens.json` is the source of truth.** The Dart constants mirror it, and `RCGLA-001-G6`
   fails the build if the two drift apart. Change both, or change neither.
3. **Only `theme/habot_theme.dart` may construct a `ThemeData`.**
4. **Every screen uses `HabotMasterScaffold`.** It exposes no padding parameter — spacing comes
   from tokens or it does not exist. `RCGLA-018-G4` scans for screens that skip it.

### Layout

| Window class | Width | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| compact | < 600dp (`xs`/`sm`) | 4 |
| medium | 600–839dp | 8 |
| expanded | ≥ 840dp | 12 |

Outer margin 16dp · **column gutter 16dp** · **vertical rhythm 8dp** · minimum supported width
320dp · side navigation collapses below 768dp · maximum 4 vertical segments on compact.

> The two gutter values are deliberate. RCGLA-012 and RCGLA-032 contradict each other in the
> step sheet; the resolution is recorded in `tokens/device_matrix.json` and gated by
> `SSTLA-004-G4`. See §6 of the methodology doc.

### Interaction

Every interactive element goes through `HabotTouchTarget`: minimum 48×48dp tap area, transparent
expansion around small icons, 8dp safety margin between neighbours, long-press for detail. Raw
`IconButton` and `GestureDetector` are banned in `lib/` (`TTMAC-011-G4`).

### Implemented steps

| # | Ref | What it delivered | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TTMCS-001 | Material 3 framework + global theme adapter, fluid containers, page frame | 7 |
| 2 | RCGLA-001 | Colour / typography / spacing / elevation / shape tokens + `tokens.json` | 6 |
| 3 | TTMCS-004 | Light/dark adaptation tokens, OS brightness listener, no-full-reflow theme scope | 9 |
| 4 | TTMCS-005 | Dark surface elevation ladder, WCAG contrast enforcement | 8 |
| 5 | SSTLA-004 | Breakpoint/column/margin/gutter decision record, device matrix, grid wireframe | 8 |
| 6 | RCGLA-012 | xs/sm breakpoints, viewport meta, `MobileGridContainer`, pixel-width lint | 7 |
| 7 | RCGLA-032 | Global layout boundary, segment listener, compact viewport checks | 7 |
| 8 | RCGLA-018 | `HabotMasterScaffold` with locked metrics and no padding escape hatch | 6 |
| 9 | ANSA-012 | 64dp contextual header, title cap, scroll elevation, double-tap-safe back | 7 |
| 10 | TTMAC-011 | 48dp touch-target framework, safety margins, long-press detail | 7 |

**72 gates.** 8 steps Complete, RCGLA-012 Partial (2 deferred), SSTLA-004 awaiting a reviewer
score.

### Open decisions

1. **Brand palette** — `tokens.json` is `PROVISIONAL` pending Brand sign-off. All colours pass
   their accessibility gates; the hex values are placeholders.
2. **Zoom lock** — RCGLA-012 substep 2 asks for `user-scalable=no`, which fails WCAG 2.1
   SC 1.4.4 and is ignored by modern iOS/Android browsers anyway. Deferred; see the comment
   block in `udf_setup/web/index.html` for the one-line override.

See the [workspace README](../README.md) for team conventions.
